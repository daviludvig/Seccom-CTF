# Hello, hat users.
This repository contains the submission of the Pilotos (Crocantes) team for the Hackathon promoted by [Seccom](https://github.com/seccom-ufsc) in collaboration with [LabSEC](https://github.com/LabSEC) at [UFSC](https://github.com/UFSC).

## Try to solve it yourself!
To promote the best possible environment for this CTF, it is recommended to install all the necessary tools in advance and solve it offline. No answers or hints for this challenge require an internet connection.

The only permissible use of the internet would be to learn a new topic, but this challenge was proposed assuming that you, spy, have comprehensive knowledge of everything related to the topics, lol.


### Install on your machine
- First and foremost, it is strongly recommended to use a Linux environment, especially the use of the Kali distribution.

 - `ghidra`, `john`, `kpcli`, `sox`, `python`.

    - With these tools, the members of Pilots (Crispy) ensure that you have everything available to find the five hidden flags within the `CTF.zip` file in this repo.

### How to progress:
Inside the zip, you are going to find 4 other zips. Three of them have `seccom{` name and the other is named classified. One of those does not have a password, begin there and you can find 2 keys inside it (You're welcome for this hint) 
- With this, you know that our flag respects the **seccom{...** prefix and ends with the closing **}**. 
- The password of those seccom zips is the flag that begins with the following letter.
    - For example, the password for `seccom{B.zip` could be `seccom{BUTter}`, got it?

#### Resolution and others
- You can find a detailed resolution in the following presentation, which was used during the project evaluation on the fifth and final day of Seccom. But ofc, you are going to try before even looking inside the walkthrough, rigth?
